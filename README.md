## Introduction

**libpath** is a small, standalone library, implemented in C with a C and a C++ API, that provides file-system path parsing and comparison, for platform-dependent - **Unix** and **Windows** - and platform-independent path manipulation. It is intended to be useful for application-level programming as well as a basis for other libraries.


## Installation

Detailed instructions - via **CMake** - are provided in the accompanying [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) file.



## Components

* **Comparing API** (C and C++);
* **Equating API** (C and C++);
* **Parsing API** (C and C++);


## Examples

Examples are provided in the ```examples``` directory.
